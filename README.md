# colonylib

Rust library implementing the Colony metadata framework for the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) network

The library currently consists of 2 parts:
1. A key store to create a new master key and derive keys for Autonomi pointer and scratchpad data types
2. A network utility for generating, uploading, and managing pods on Autonomi
